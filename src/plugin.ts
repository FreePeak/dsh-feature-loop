/**
 * The DSH plugin surface for the feature loop's policies.
 *
 * This module is what replaced the vendored `agent.ts` / `index.ts` fork. Rather
 * than owning a copy of the agent loop, it *hosts the policies on the loop the
 * harness already runs*, through the extension points upstream publishes:
 *
 *   agent/pre-step     step and cost ceilings, the detectors, the judge, and the
 *                      reversibility gate. Returning `{kind:'reject'}` is how a
 *                      ceiling stops a run.
 *   agent/request      the cheap-first ladder, applied to the call's route.
 *   tools/execute      the gate at the tool boundary, where the tool name is
 *                      finally known — one layer below `agent/pre-step`.
 *
 * The `tools/execute` hook is the reason the fork is no longer needed. The old
 * fork consulted the gate from its own copy of `executeToolCalls` and therefore
 * delivered a gate-raised review *one step late*, after the tool had already
 * run (see the `ponytail:` note this replaces). Here the call can be denied
 * before dispatch.
 *
 * Nothing in this module reimplements the loop. It reads the harness's events
 * and answers them.
 *
 * @module @freepeak/dsh-feature-loop/plugin
